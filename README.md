# EDA_projects

## This repository contains data science projects associated with exploratory data analysis (EDA).

1. In the ETH cryptocurrency sentiment analysis project, I analysed a large dataset containing all reddit comments mentioning the word Ethereum since 2011.
From this I used Natural Languae Processing (MLP) techniques to deduce the sentiment changes surrounding ETH over time.

THe report associated with this project can be found on Medium.
